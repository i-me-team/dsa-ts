# dsa-ts

A typescript project for practising data structures and algorithm problems

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Bun.js (if not already installed).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-ts.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd dsa-ts`.
4. Install dependencies: `bun install`.

## Usage

I have used VS Code as the default editor and provided the settings for directly running the file through code runner. If you plan to use the terminal directly:

```bash
bun "/location/of/your/project/dsa-ts/src/graphs/driver.ts"
```
